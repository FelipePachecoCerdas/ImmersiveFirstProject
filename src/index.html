                  Costa Rica is a small country located in Central America. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
                  printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
                  the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                  book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                  remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                  containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                  PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
